# Project Concept
This project was primarily designed as an attempt to learn flutter and firebase. Its development time was around 2 months and it has not been deployed yet (as of 16/03/2024).

# Tech Stack
The project is made using 

# 1- Flutter:
Flutter is a popular option for developing web apps and with the provide timeline, it was the only feasible option. Flutter uses a widgets-based architecture and has dart as the programming language. Having previously worked with java, darts learning curve was rather easy.

# 2- Firebase:
Firebase is the easiest and most convenient option to use with flutter. It provides a ton of useful features like authentication, notifications (which have been used in this project) and much more. However, firebase does have hefty charges for large scale projects.

# A Non Profit Project:
Unlike other pojects, this projects idea was to primarily fix a problem in a convenient form. It does have test ads included. Howevere, those ads revenue would have to be hypothetically donated to relevant charities.
